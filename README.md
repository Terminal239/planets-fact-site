## My process

### Built with

* Semantic HTML5 markup
* SASS/SCSS
* Flexbox
* CSS Grid
* Mobile-first workflow
* React: [https://reactjs.org/](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
* Next.js: [https://nextjs.org/](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework

### What I learned

This project challenged my layout skills, especially for a multipage website. I specifically gained valuable experience with:

* **Dynamic Routing in Next.js:**  Implementing dynamic routes to create adaptable planet pages.

### Continued development

I want to explore more advanced applications of dynamic routing and further enhance my understanding of  Next.js data fetching methods.
